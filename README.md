# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which are configuration files for various tools and applications. These dotfiles help me customize my development environment and streamline my workflow.

## Getting Started

To use these dotfiles, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArchanjoJr/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

2. Change into the dotfiles directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ```

3. Run the installation script:

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```
    or 
    ```
    make install
    ```
    This script will symlink the dotfiles to their appropriate locations in your home directory.

4. Customize the dotfiles to your liking. You can modify the existing configuration files or add new ones as needed.
